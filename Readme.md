# Rust Programming Language Tutorial

This code based on Rust book and it covers the basics of Rust programming language, including syntax, data types, control flow, functions, ownership, error handling, concurrency, and more.

You can find the source code for each section in the corresponding directory. For example, the source code for the "Hello, World!" program is located in the `hello-world` directory in `chapter-1`.
